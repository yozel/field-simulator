# Classical Field Theory Simulator
This is a toy project I work on while learning physics and math as a hobby. It's not accurate and probably will never be.

## TODO:
    - [x] Display field vectors (display magnitute as color)
    - [x] Implement inverse-square law
    - [x] Add charges to the particles
    - [ ] Implement speed of light and relative positions
